## Description

In this application, I have created a workout tracker. I was already provided with the front end code in the `Public` folder. In order to complete the backend code, I created a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

## Installation

All you need to do is click the link and get working.

## Usage

With this app, the user is able to view, create, and track daily workouts, including multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. They are able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, they can also track distance traveled.  When the site loads the user is presented with the homepage, which displays the last workout logged.  They can then either press “Continue Workout” or “New Workout”.  By clicking “New Workout”, the user can start a new workout and can choose the type of exercise they want to add.  If they choose “Resistance”, they can fill out a form to add a resistance exercise.  When the user clicks “Add Exercise”, the exercise is added to their current workout.  Similarly, if they choose to add a “Cardio” exercise, they are shown another form to fill out.  Once the user has finished adding exercises, they can push the “Complete” button, and will be taken back to the homepage with their current workout summery.  When the user clicks “Dashboard”, they can view their workout stats.  If they click the “Fitness Tracker” link, they are returned to the home page and can start all over again.
